# KarimLearnsToCode

In this repository, I will add all my weekly submission Java code from my blog: Karimlearnstocode.wordpress.com

My java post normally occurs at 8pm GMT
I will try to upload my code within the following day here on GitHub. 
If you find any errors, please send me a message on the wordpress (or leave a message here if possible?)
Happy Coding!
